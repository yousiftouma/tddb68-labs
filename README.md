# Pintos
Repository for lab work in the TDDB68 course @ LiU

The labs revolve around the Pintos Operating System developed at Stanford University. 
The different tasks in the course are based on the original Pintos Project and include, but are not limited to, 
implementing system calls and synchronization.
